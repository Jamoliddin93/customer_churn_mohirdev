**Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction**
This Python project focuses on predicting passenger satisfaction based on various features in the airline industry. The dataset includes information such as gender, age, flight class, in-flight services, and more. The primary objective is to build machine learning models capable of accurately predicting whether a passenger is satisfied or dissatisfied.

Dataset Overview
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with features encompassing a wide range of aspects related to the passenger experience. Exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the distribution of features and their correlation with passenger satisfaction.

Data Preprocessing
The dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting into training and testing sets. Exploratory analysis identifies key features strongly correlated with passenger satisfaction.

Model Building
Several machine learning models are implemented and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier. Each model is trained on the training set and evaluated on a holdout validation set.

Model Evaluation
Model accuracy is assessed for each algorithm, providing insights into their performance on the validation set. Random Forest Classifier emerges as a strong performer, achieving a high accuracy rate.

Prediction and Submission
The Random Forest Classifier is selected as the final model for making predictions on the test set. The predicted results are then submitted in a CSV format for assessment and scoring.
